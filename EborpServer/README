To start using Eborp you'll need to do the following:

For each Raspberry Pi, set it up using the provided image, this contains:
	- airmon-ng (tool to enable wireless monitoring mode)
	- TShark (command-line tool for packet sniffing)
	- Eborp client (to connect to the server)
	- Start/stop scripting

For the server:
1) Install Java and run EborpServer
2) Set up some DNS (BIND?) for the Pi's to do a lookup?s
